# DynamoDB Basics
This project will give you introduction to basics of DynamoDB. It covers basic operations like creating table, adding items to table, reading those items and finally deleting them.

Though I have used Python for writing code, you can use same logic with programming languages while using DynamoDB.

If you found any issues or have some improvements for this repo do let me know.
